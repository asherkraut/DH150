## Introduction:

Every great product is built especially for its users. Without understanding the potnetial product's users, it is nearly impossible to actually create value in their lives. UX storytelling is the art form that addresses this very idea. Through UX storytelling we can contextualize users, understand their specific needs, and move closer toward a solution not just for one target demographic that we may have previously planned, but all the unplanned user paths as well. Through creating these personas and empathy maps, I took yet another major step in my path toward becoming a great UX designer. Becoming a critical listener and being able to regurgitate things as simple as a user's goals, mindset, and ambitions is a lot harder than it sounds and I am greatful to now fully understand the importance of continuing to become a better UX storyteller. This skill is applicable not just to product design, but everything life. If you can understand how and why people feel the ways they do, you can understand how to alter or remedy those feelings, which is incredibly value. 

## Three Features I Want to Design:

1. Certainly the first feature I want to (re)design is the homework calendar on the students' online portals. Redesigning this feature correctly will completely eliminate the need for students to write down homework in-class daily saving time, paper, and energy. 

2. Next, I am going to (re)design the school lunch menu interface entirely. Currently, the school lunch menus are nested within multiple vague dropdown menus and helping to improve the site's navigability via this (re)design will be instrumental in giving parents and students both the clarity they deserve and demand when evaluating the lunch options. 

3. Lastly, while having a (re)designed student homework portal will be great, it will only be as valuable as the information that is posted to it by the teacher. In an effort to increase the reliability of this calendar I plan to implement a daily teacher notification system that will remind teachers that their students are counting on them to post this information promptly.
