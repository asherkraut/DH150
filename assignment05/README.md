## Introduction:

UX Storytelling

## Three Features I Want to Design:

1. Certainly the first feature I want to (re)design is the homework calendar on the students' online portals. Redesigning this feature correctly will completely eliminate the need for students to write down homework in-class daily saving time, paper, and energy. 

2. Next, I am going to (re)design the school lunch menu interface entirely. Currently, the school lunch menus are nested within multiple vague dropdown menus and helping to improve the site's navigability via this (re)design will be instrumental in giving parents and students both the clarity they deserve and demand when evaluating the lunch options. 

3. Lastly, while having a (re)designed student homework portal will be great, it will only be as valuable as the information that is posted to it by the teacher. In an effort to increase the reliability of this calendar I plan to implement a daily teacher notification system that will remind teachers that their students are counting on them to post this information promptly.
