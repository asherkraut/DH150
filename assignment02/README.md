# DH150 - Assignment 02 - Usability Testing

## Introduction

mtps.org is a mobile and desktop website for the Marlboro Township Public School District in Marlboro, NJ. The website is used by students, parents, and teachers for all sorts of aids in the learning process such as homework calendars, links to additional activities, human resources, school lunch menus, and more. Students, parents, and teachers are also able to create personalized logins where they can access certain features of the website specific to their needs. 

After conducting a thorough design heuristics evaluation of the website, I've determined that usability testing is required to begin moving forward toward mapping out a plan for a redesign. One of the main heuristic violations that I want to test for is user control and freedom as when originally evaluating the website I found it difficult myself to navigate the website. Additionally, the aesthetic and minimalist design principle was violated and I want to gather user feedback to see if unbiased users are in agreement that this was a point of emphasis for a redesign. Thus, I will conduct a pilot usability test this week with a live user interacting directly with the desktop website, mtps.org. In general, usability testing allows for seeing unbiased users interact with products for the purposes of extracting meaningful feedback for improving the product. 

## Methodology:

The pilot usability test will be conducted inside my apartment in Los Angeles, CA, 90025, more specifically in my home office, as conditions will not permit for anything else given the nation-wide lockdown. The participant will use one laptop for both interacting with the website and responding to a usability test questionnaire that I put together in the portable minimalistic lab setup. The laptop's screen will be split in half with the website on the left-hand side and the questionnaire on the right-hand side. Additionally, the laptop's camera will capture the emotions and facial expressions of the tester in real-time. I will act as the moderator and lead the user through the test and help capture the user's navigational choices, task completion rates, satisfaction ratings, and more. The moderator and the participant will sit adjacent to each other. Again, to reitirate, this is a pilot trial and is meant to test the setting, materials, and software in order to improve the usability testing process.

The test will first introduce the usability test process to the participant as they may never have participated in a setting like such. After gaining the user's permission to proceed via informed consent, the participant will fill out the included background questions about whether or not the user has interacted with the product before as well as his/her specific use case for previous interaction. The test will then include a series of pre-test questions that ask the user about their thoughts on the product's ease of use based on appearance solely before any interaction. Afterwards, the test will include a series of tasks, 3 to be specific, that will ask the user to interact with the desktop website to complete various goals. These tasks include checking for the school lunch menu, logging into the teacher portal, and checking for school closures due to holidays. 

Overall, the test will measure the participant's opinions on the app's ease of use, efficiency of use, expected frequency of use, learnability, aesthetics, and content organization.
