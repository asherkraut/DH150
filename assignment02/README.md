# DH150 - Assignment 02 - Usability Testing

## Introduction

mtps.org is a mobile and desktop website for the Marlboro Township Public School District in Marlboro, NJ. The website is used by students, parents, and teachers for all sorts of aids in the learning process such as homework calendars, links to additional activities, human resources, school lunch menus, and more. Students, parents, and teachers are also able to create personalized logins where they can access certain features of the website specific to their needs. 

After conducting a thorough design heuristics evaluation of the website, I've determined that usability testing is required to begin moving forward toward mapping out a plan for a redesign. One of the main heuristic violations that I wanted to test for was user control and freedom as when originally evaluating I found it difficult myself to nvagiate the website. Additionally, the aesthetic and minimalist design principle was violated and I wanted to gather user feedback to see if unbiased users were in agreement that this was a point of emphasis for a redesign. Thus, this past week I conducted usability testing with a live user interacting directly with the desktop website, mtps.org. Usability testing allows for seeing unbiased users interact with products for the purposes of extracting meaningful feedback for improving the product. 

The test took place inside my apartment, specifically in my home office, as conditions did not permit for anything else given the nation-wide lockdown. The participant used one laptop for both interacting with the website and responding to a usability test questionnaire that I put together in the portable minimalistic lab setup. Additionally, the laptop's camera captured the emotions and facial expressions of the tester. I acted as the moderator and led the user through the test and helped capture the user's navigational choices, task completion rates, satisfaction ratings, and more. 

This test was merely just a pilot test for further usability testing. The test included background questions about whether or not the user had interacted with the product before as well as his/her specific use case for previous interaction. The test then had a series of pre-test questions that asked the user about their thoughts on the product's ease of use based on appearance solely, no interaction. Afterwards, the test included a series of tasks, 3 to be specific, that asked the user to interactive with the desktop website to complete various goals. These tasks included checking for the school lunch menu, logging into the teacher portal, and checking for school closures due to holidays. 

Overall, the test was aimed at getting a better understanding for the product's ease of use and seeing if I was able to confirm/deny the findings from my heuristic evaluation I made previously.
