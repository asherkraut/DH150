# DH150 - Assignment 04 - Contextual Inquiry

## Introduction:

**Step 1: Specify the main design challenge**

1. What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing? 
    
    Redesigning the Marlboro Township Public School District website would allow users to be able to check school calendars, lunch offerings, homework assignments, and more, all within the same platform. The platform is intended for usage by all different users such as teachers, students, parents, coaches, and more. Having a redesigned platform to access these resources will allow for more time focusing on learning and less time spent on mundane technical difficulties. 

2. What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
    
    This activity fufills all of the different users' same basic need for continuous access to their assignments, calendars, and more. There is always that age-old concern shared by students, teachers, and parents alike that information will be loss in translation from teachers to students to parents and so having this increased transparency is crucial. 
    
3. What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs? 
    
    The current solution in place is the school district's current website. The current website lacks crucial navigation features that ultimately defeat the purpose of the platform itself. If the information is not easily and readily available to all it is as good as the platform not functioning at all. Alternatives to the current site may look like google calendars for homework created by teachers, emailing back and forth from parents to teachers for information, and students notepads where they may write down the information learned in class. 

4. What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
    
    One of the biggest limitations here that can be improved with digital technology is the lack of clarity in student assignments. As it stands students come home and tell their parents about what assignments they have, but the parents are not filled in on the teacher's words from class about the assignments. Having a redesigned platform to offer this to users could solve that by allowing teachers to post all of their content in real-time, eliminating the information lag. This will inevitably allow parents to offer more dedicated help to their children instead of having to wait multiple days for clarification. 
    
**Step 2: Identify Target Users**

1. What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
    
    Demographic: Marlboro Township (NJ) residents, elementary and middle school students aged 5-14, technologically capable parents with children in the school district, teachers and administrators within the district
    
    Preferences: Users have the preference of accessing school related information online instead of using traditional pencil/notepad methods. 

    Expertise: Users should not and will not need any prior knowledge or technical expertise to use this website

2. Where would the users do that activity? (ex. context of use)

    There is a few specific use cases that come to mind in regards to this website. The first, and perhaps most obvious use case, would be a student accessing a log of all their assignments, in class exercises, etc., after coming home from school. This allows them to no longer be responsible for writing everything down verbatim in class and can focus on absorbing knowledge instead. The next use-case would be for parents looking for general knowledge related to school perhaps like a vacation calendar if they're eager to plan a getaway or even checking the lunch menu to see if the options are healthy enough so they don't have to pack their child lunch. They would use this site either on the go using a mobile device or using their home computer. Lastly, teachers would be hoping to use the platform in their homes as well, uploading documents far in advace of using them in class so that parents and student have an idea of what to expect moving forward. 

3. What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

    Completeing these activities would require different steps depending on the user. The student would have their own designated log-in where they can input their username and password to platform and receive a customized view of only their assignments and their courses. Parents could then use their children's log-in to view the same, or even operate the site as a guest where they'd have access to pdfs of the school calendar, lunch menus, announcements, etc. Teachers, similar to students, would have a designated log-in where they can access their website editor and would have the option to browse their computer for files to upload, post class notes, make announcements, and more, all in an intuitive user interface. 
    
**Step 3: Pick Observation Methods**

   For my observations I decided to use the direct observation method by asking my sister, a current parent of an elementary school student in the Marlboro Township Public School District, to participate in a thorough interview with me. In the interview we focused mainly on her specific use-cases for the school's website, what the website means to her, and how she might change its functionality to make it more useful for herself. Below you can find the script used to interview, the raw interview itself, and my notes from the session.
