# DH150 - Assignment 04 - Contextual Inquiry

## Introduction:

Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

1. What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing? 
    
    Redesigning the Marlboro Township Public School District website would allow users to be able to check school calendars, lunch offerings, homework assignments, and more, all within the same platform. The platform is intended for usage by all different users such as teachers, students, parents, coaches, and more. Having a redesigned platform to access these resources will allow for more time focusing on learning and less time spent on mundane technical difficulties. 

2. What is the basic need involved for that activity?
    
    This activity fufills all of the different users' same basic need for continuous access to their assignments, calendars, and more. There is always that age-old concern shared by students, teachers, and parents alike that information will be loss in translation from teachers to students to parents and so having this increased transparency is crucial. 
    
3. What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
    
    The current solution in place is the school district's current website. The current website lacks crucial navigation features that ultimately defeat the purpose of the platform itself. If the information is not easily and readily available to all it is as good as the platform not functioning at all. Alternatives to the current site may look like google calendars for homework created by teachers, emailing back and forth from parents to teachers for information, and students notepads where they may write down the information learned in class. 

4. What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
