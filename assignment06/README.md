## Introduction:

>The world is unpredictable to say the least: we can hope for the best, but at the end of the day nature is out of our control. In late 2019, we saw the outbreak of a global pandemic and collectively we were not ready. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, society has been forced to pivot virtual. We've seen entire corporations tell their employees to work from home indefinitely using slack, zoom, and several other communication tools. Additionally, we've seen schools around the world, UCLA included, move all classes online, with great uncertainty as to what the future holds. That said, it's clear that there is a need now more than ever for improved education technology in order to facilitate this transition. At the start of the quarter having this in mind I chose to center my design project around redesigning a public school district website that I used growing up in my hometown of Marlboro, NJ. The website serves as a platform for students, teachers, parents, and administrators to collectively collaborate online to monitor students' learning progress. The website is meant to feature school lunch menus, homework calendars, and so much more. 

>Through user research, I found that the school district's website is not as effective as it could be in its ability to extend the physical classroom online. One of the biggest areas for improvement that users identified was the website's homework calendar. Not only is the calendar hard to navigate to, but in addition uploading to the calendar for teachers takes much too long even for the most technology savy of users. One of the users I interviewed was a young 4th grade teacher who had used online education tools in her school days yet still had trouble uploading for her students and their parents to see the homework of the week. On the other end of this problem, I was hearing consistently that students were having a tough time using the calendar as it currently stands because there is a reliability issue. Essentially, because the platform is difficult for teachers to upload, they don't. When the teachers don't upload the assignments, students struggle to keep up with monitoring what is expected of them, creating a lose lose situation for all. 

>After drawing conclusions on my user research, I created three different personas to simulate user scenarios. I was keen on focusing on all perspectives of this information/navigation problem: teachers, students, and parents. At the end of the day, parents just want to be kept in the loop on what is going on in school, teachers want to provide as much knowledge to their students as they can, and students want to learn as much as they can. That said, I created the three personas with this in mind: Salma Calor, Chris Collins, and Claudia Reynolds. Salma Calor is a 28 year-old 4th grade teacher who wants an easier way to post homework assignments of the week. Chris Collins is a 6th grade students who needs a better way to ensure the accuracy of the online calendar. Claudia Reynolds is a 32 year-old mother of 3 and wants a better way to check on the lunch menus that doesn't just say what's being served, but also gives pricing and nutrition information. 

>As a result of these three personas, I elected to redesign the following three unique usage scenarios, although slightly interconnected at the same time:

>1. Design a notification system that alerts teachers to upload homework every morning on a recurring basis via a mobile device push notification. Additionally, I have redesigned the UI of the upload screen to ensure it is as friction-less as possible. 
>2. Design a notification system for students that alerts them when their teachers have published the day's homework, to ensure they are seeing the most up to date information. 
>3. Add nutrition information to the daily lunch menu as well as pricing information.
