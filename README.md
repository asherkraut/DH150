### My UX Project: Redesigning The Marlboro Township (NJ) Public School District Website

After doing a thorough design analysis of two different public school districts websites' I've decided to go with the one that has held more sentimental value to me for the majority of my life. I analyzed both the website for the Marlboro, NJ Public School District, which is in fact my hometown, as well as the website for the Los Angeles Unified School District. My detailed analysis of both of these websites can be found below. 

## Heuristic Evaluation #1 - Marlboro Township Public School District Website 

OVERVIEW 

As a child who grew up in Marlboro, NJ one website that I visited almost every single day was the Marlboro Township Public School website. This website was the center for all things school related from first grade to eighth grade. Anytime teachers would post homework assignments we would find them on this site. Anytime school was potentially closing because of a snow day we would aggresively refresh this website at 4AM in the morning to see if we could go back to sleep. Thus, needless to say, it was and still is imperative that this website have a design that is both gorgeous and user focused at its core. Upon further investigation into my previous school district’s website I found that while they have done quite a redesign since my time there, the design fails in more ways than I could count. With that said, I hope to give the children of Marlboro, NJ the experience they don’t just desserve, but need to accelerate their growth as students and individuals. 

OVERALL EVALUATION

Upon reviewing this website I have found it to be functional as in the actual website works through hard trial and error one could find what they were looking for.  However, the website fails such that actually finding what you’re looking for takes an eternity so overall its design is not user focused. The design does not account for the fact that both parents and students use the website so there is a large gap in the ease of use from the two user personas. On the one hand, students since motivated to check their homework and play around on their devices might be able to overcome the difficulty of use and still find what they are looking for. However, when parents try to use this, especially parents like mine, they’d be at a loss for words and in extreme frustration given the lack of great UX design. That said, I am really looking forward to redesigning this website such to make it easier for all!

1. Visibility of System Status

This heuristic deals with the idea that the website, mobile application, or product in general should always give the user a look into what is currently happening on the application/website within a reasonable amount of time. Thus, great visibility of system status will allow the user to know where they are in the application in real-time and never leave the user in a state of confusion or limbo. 

The website of choice maintains a poor visibility of system status throughout its use and thus violates this heuristic. If you select an option using the top menu and arrive at the page it does not change its status as shown in the screenshots below. In the example screenshots I expected see to see option I choose highlighted to tell me which page of the website I was on but, instead it remains the same. Simply inverting the colors of the option selected could alleviate this problem allowing users to see into what’s happening and where they are in the website. 

2. Match Between the System and the Real World

This heuristic deals with the idea that the completed product should use the same language, gestures, concepts, etc. that the user is faimiliar with. That said, the system should follow the same real-world conventions such that the user does not have to guess as to what certain items on the screen mean. 

The website of choice does in fact abide by this design heuristic. When selecting an option on the top line I would expect the sub-options to be displayed below as they would be across the other platforms I’ve used in the real world. Additionally, the words are relatively clear and intuitive. For example, when I read the words “Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information” I know that just like when I watch news channels, this will include all news related to this topic. 

3. User Control and Freedom

This heuristic deals with the idea that it is common for a user to choose an option by mistake and the system should offer them a way to undo or redo their selection. 

The website of choice fails miserably here and violates the heuristic of user control and freedom. When I press on the district calendar for 2019-2020 it takes me to a pdf screen with no top options bar or any method of returning to the previous page. The only way to return and undo my mistake is by using my browser’s feature. A way around this would be to embed the pdf viewer within the exsisting UI design so that users will have the appearance of being within the same system and not feel like they can not undo their action. 

4. Consistency and Standards

This heuristic deals with the idea that the fonts, styles, borders, sizes, etc. should all follow some consistent trend. Users shouldn’t be left guessing whether or not a different color means something different due to a lack of uniformity. 

The website of choice fails miserably in this heuristic of consistency and standards as well. When hovering over buttons nearly every single button has a different highlight color which is extremely confusing for the user. When using the website I have no idea which color represents the hover and which is just asthetic. In the screenshots below you can see a black cover for hover recognition as well as yellow and blue. Standardizing this hovering color would make it much more seamless. 

5. Error Prevention

This heuristic deals with the idea that systems not only should have clear, concise error messages that users can understand but, great systems prevent the errors from occuring in the first place. This is typically done through a confirmation page for major actions or common mistake points and/or a check for conditions. 

The school district’s website violates this heuristic of error prevention in that it does not do a great job in preventing the user from making major mistakes. If we look at the same situation of going to the district calendar we are not given the option to confirm this selection or realize its severity. Going to the district calendar takes us completely outside the interface of the website and thus, this is considered a major action and a confirmation page should appear for the user so they could prevent doing so if desired. Instead we are directed straight to the page and unfortunately are left in a state of uncertainty. 

6. Recognition Rather Than Recall 

This heuristic deals with the idea that systems should minize the amount of knowledge a user needs to memorize. Users should be prompted with choices and just have to select which choices they prefer. As little memory from the user as possible is preferred for ease of use purposes.

The school district’s website violates this heuristic of favoring recognition over recall quite a few times. One of the biggest design flaws I noticed in regards to this was the fact that the main menu options were not clear enough whatsoever. If user’s wanted to access the calendar of events they would have to previously have memorized the fact that this falls under the “district” option instead of perhaps a much clearer option such as Schedule. 

7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

This heuristic deals with the idea that great systems should allow for experienced users to move ahead via shortcuts called accelerators. Advanced users should not have to take the rudimentary route of completing actions as someone who was using the application for the first time. 

This website does not fair well at all in terms of flexibility and efficiency of use and violates this heuristic. If you were an experienced user and wanted to quickly sign-in to your account you would have to manually scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and find the link to do so as pictured below. Instead, there should be an extremely visible accelerator at the top right or left corner of the screen so experienced users do not have to do any navigating for use. This would also not slow down first time users whatsoever. 

8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 

This heuristic deals with the idea that information conveyed on the screen should as direct as possible. Anything extra is distracting to the user. 

The website of choosing once again violates this crucial design heuristic of minimalist design. The website is absolutely flooded with options to choose from with what seems like no consolidation whatsoever. For example, under the district heading there are three different suboptions with a calendar reference. It would be so much easier and more visually appealing if there were to just be one calendar option and then have users select from there. Instead these all appear at the same time and clutter the screen as shown. 

9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors

This heuristic deals with the idea that error messages should be expressed in plain language without any sort of abstract computer code. Users should be able to understand the mistake they made clearly so they can easily correct it. Great systems will also propose a solution on the spot. 

The school district’s website does in fact abide by the heuristic of allowing users to easily recognize, diagnose, and recover from their errors. When attempting to login to a student’s account if their login credentials are incorrect there is a very clear error message displayed at the top of the screen stating the user has entered an incorrect password and/or email. This is done well as it tells the user almost exactly what to fix in order to succeed in their use. 

10. Help and Documentation

This heuristic deals with the idea that it is sometimes necesarry to offer help and documentation to users so they know how to use the system in the event they are confused. This instructional information should be extremely clear, concise, and easy to navigate such that users do not have to read the entire documentation. 

The school district’s website violates this heuristic of help and documentation. While it is not as severe as some of the other design heuristic violates mentioned previously since there is in fact a search bar the top of the screen, there is still a clear violation. There is not searchable help button or even an easy FAQ list. This should for sure be an added option to the unorganized, cluttered heading bar.
