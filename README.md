### My UX Project: Redesigning The Marlboro Township (NJ) Public Schools Website

After doing a thorough design analysis of two different public school districts websites' I've decided to go with the one that has held more sentimental value to me for the majority of my life. I analyzed both the website for the Marlboro, NJ Public School District, which is in fact my hometown, as well as the website for the Los Angeles Unified School District. My detailed analysis of both of these websites can be found below.
