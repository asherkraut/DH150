### My UX Project: Redesigning The Marlboro Township (NJ) Public School District Website

After doing a thorough design analysis of two different public school districts websites' I've decided to go with the one that has held more sentimental value to me for the majority of my life. I analyzed both the website for the Marlboro, NJ Public School District, which is in fact my hometown, as well as the website for the Los Angeles Unified School District. My detailed analysis of both of these websites can be found below. 

## Heuristic Evaluation #1 - Marlboro Township Public School District Website 

OVERVIEW

As a child who grew up in Marlboro, NJ one website that I visited almost every single day was the Marlboro Township Public School website. This website was the center for all things school related from first grade to eighth grade. Anytime teachers would post homework assignments we would find them on this site. Anytime school was potentially closing because of a snow day we would aggresively refresh this website at 4AM in the morning to see if we could go back to sleep. Thus, needless to say, it was and still is imperative that this website have a design that is both gorgeous and user focused at its core. Upon further investigation into my previous school district’s website I found that while they have done quite a redesign since my time there, the design fails in more ways than I could count. With that said, I hope to give the children of Marlboro, NJ the experience they don’t just desserve, but need to accelerate their growth as students and individuals.
